            <h3><em>The following content is from an in-depth investigation of the conspiracy theories surround the attacks of 9/11,<br>which was published in the March 2005 issue of Popular Mechanics. That cover story was expanded and published in<br>August 2006 as a book titled Debunking 9/11 Myths.</em></h3>

            <p>The collapse of both World Trade Center towers—and the smaller WTC 7 a few hours later—initially surprised even some experts. <br>But subsequent studies have shown that the WTC's structural integrity was destroyed by intense fire as well as the severe damage inflicted by the planes.<br> That explanation hasn't swayed conspiracy theorists, who contend that all three buildings were wired with explosives in advance and<br> razed in a series of controlled demolitions.</p><br>

        <h3>WIDESPREAD DAMAGE</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Claim:</strong> The first hijacked plane crashed through the 94th to the 98th floors of the World Trade Center's 110-story North Tower; the second jet slammed <br>into the 78th to the 84th floors of the 110-story South Tower. The impact and ensuing fires disrupted elevator service in both buildings.<br> Plus, the lobbies of both buildings were visibly damaged before the towers collapsed. "There is NO WAY the impact of the jet caused such widespread <br>damage 80 stories below," claims a posting on the San Diego Independent Media Center Web site (sandiego.indymedia.org). <br>"It is OBVIOUS and irrefutable that OTHER EXPLOSIVES (... such as concussion bombs) HAD ALREADY BEEN DETONATED in the lower levels of tower one at the same time as the plane crash."</p>

            <p><strong>FACT:</strong> Following up on a May 2002 preliminary report by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a major study will be released in spring 2005 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce. NIST shared its initial findings with PM and made its lead researcher available to our team of reporters.</p></main>
